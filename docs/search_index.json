Are you unsure what the level of mathematics is you need for the Statistics &amp; Data Science master? Do you want to prepare in advance? This pre-master is a collection of lectures and exercises to give prospective students a better idea of what to expect. This pre-master is work in progress. Please check back later for updates. Always consult the official University website for the latest accurate information on the Statistics &amp; Data Science master programme. "],["overview.html", "Chapter 1 Overview 1.1 Useful Links 1.2 What Is Taught in the Master?", " Chapter 1 Overview An overview of the pre-master. This pre-master allows you to have a peek inside the Statistics &amp; Data Science master programme. This way you can judge more easily whether the programme is something for you, and whether you are sufficiently confident in your mathematics skills. You can also use this pre-master to prepare for the first semester. Please note that the pre-master is neither a requirement for, nor a guarantee of admission to the master programme. For the actual requirements and other information regarding the master programme, always consult the official Leiden University websites. 1.1 Useful Links Link to the course description (subject to change when the name of the programme does) Link to the prospectus (outdated?)

To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio. Even if you have an existing version, I recommend getting the latest version using the guide below. 2.1 Installation Guide If youre comfortable with computer software, it boils down to: Install R; Install RStudio; Open RStudio and try to knit a template R markdown file. If you cant knit to PDF, see the note below and try knitting to HTML instead. Note about TinyTeX TinyTeX is not required for this pre-master. If you want to knit to PDF, you have to install TinyTeX. This has several advantages over HTML and Word, which are explained in the second video. For the portfolio, all you need is a working version of RStudio, and to be able to knit to HTML. Note about installation problems in general To ensure a smooth experience throughout the pre-master, address installation issues early on. In case of problems, see the general tips below, or try asking a question on Stackoverflow. Some general tips that will save you a lot of headaches with software during your education: Setting your system language to English (Windows, Mac) makes everything a lot easier to find; If you store data in Excel, setting the decimal separator to a dot (.) instead of a comma (,) will also save you a lot of extra effort; If you are on Windows, I highly recommend working on an account with administrator rights and setting user account control to Never notify. (Link says Windows 7 &amp; 8, but it works the same for Windows 10.) 2.2 About RStudio &amp; R Markdown Watch the video on the RStudio interface below. 2.3 About the R Language There are two great tutorial for learning the basics in R. This video shows how to use them: 2.4 Tutorials In every chapter there will be exercises in RStudio to teach you how to program and how to perform statistical calculations in R. 2.4.1 Exercise: swirl Watch the part about swirl and complete chapters 1, 2, 4, 7 &amp; 8 from the R Programming course. 2.4.2 Exercise learnr (optional) Many data scientists prefer the tidyverse over base R. This is a collection of packages aimed at writing code in a more tidy manner, using the pipeline notation. Complete the Data basics, Filter observations, Create new variables and Summarise Tables chapters from the learnr package as explained in the video. (If you dont see a Tutorial tab, try running install.packages(\"learnr\") in the console and then restart RStudio.) From here on out, I will assume basic familiarity with R syntax and the RStudio interface.
